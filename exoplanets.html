			<h1>What are exoplanets?</h1>
			<p>Exoplantes are planets that oribit a star other than our own sun. The planets are so close to each other and the star that there are seven of them within a space five times smaller than the distance from Mercury to our sun. This proximity allows the researchers to study the planets in depth as well, gaining insight about planetary systems other than our own.
			Estimates of their mass also indicate that they are rocky planets, rather than being gaseous like Jupiter. Three planets are in the habitable zone of the star, known as TRAPPIST-1e, f and g, and may even have oceans on the surface.</p>

				<p>TRAPPIST-1a. Does it even exist? The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is the organization which generally sets conventions and definitions in naming exoplanets. The star, according to this convention is "A", whereas all the exoplanets are given the letters "b" and onwards.</p>
