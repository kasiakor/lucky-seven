			<h1>Lucky seven</h1>
			<h2>Astronomers have discovered seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a star called TRAPPIST-1.</h2>
			<p>“The discovery gives us a hint that finding a second Earth is not just a matter of if, but when,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters.
			Zurbuchen called it a "major step forward" towards the goal of answering the very big question: Is there life on other worlds?</p>

			<h3>About star TRAPPIST-1</h3>
			<p>The TRAPPIST-1 star, an ultracool dwarf, has seven Earth-size planets orbiting it. The researchers believe that TRAPPIST-1f in particular is the best candidate for supporting life. It's a bit cooler than Earth, but could be suitable with the right atmosphere and enough greenhouse gases.</p>

			<h3>Earth's seven sisters</h3>
			<p>Seven small planets whose surfaces could harbour liquid water have been spotted around a nearby dwarf star. If such a configuration is common in planetary systems, our Galaxy could be teeming with Earth-like planets.</p>
