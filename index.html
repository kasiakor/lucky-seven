		<h1>Lucky number seven</h1>
		<h2>Astronomers have discovered seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a star called TRAPPIST-1.</h2>
		<p>“The discovery gives us a hint that finding a second Earth is not just a matter of if, but when,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters.
		Zurbuchen called it a "major step forward" towards the goal of answering the very big question: Is there life on other worlds?</p>

		
		<h3>About TRAPPIST-1</h3>
		<p>The TRAPPIST-1 star, an ultracool dwarf, has seven Earth-size planets orbiting it. The researchers believe that TRAPPIST-1f in particular is the best candidate for supporting life. It's a bit cooler than Earth, but could be suitable with the right atmosphere and enough greenhouse gases.</p>

		<h3>What are exoplanets?</h3>
		<p>Exoplantes are planets that oribit a star other than our own sun. The planets are so close to each other and the star that there are seven of them within a space five times smaller than the distance from Mercury to our sun. This proximity allows the researchers to study the planets in depth as well, gaining insight about planetary systems other than our own.
		Estimates of their mass also indicate that they are rocky planets, rather than being gaseous like Jupiter. Three planets are in the habitable zone of the star, known as TRAPPIST-1e, f and g, and may even have oceans on the surface.</p>
